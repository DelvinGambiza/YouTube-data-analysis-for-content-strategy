# Youtube data analysis for content creation strategy
Overview

This project explores trends in YouTube videos to identify key factors influencing engagement metrics such as views, likes, and dislikes. Using the USvideos dataset, the analysis reveals insights into how categories, metadata, and timing contribute to video performance. Python was used for preprocessing and statistical analysis, while Tableau facilitated interactive visualizations.

Key Objectives
	1.	Understand how video categories impact engagement (views, likes, and dislikes).
	2.	Analyze the influence of metadata (e.g., title length, description length, tag  count) on performance.
	3.	Investigate time-related trends, such as how quickly videos become trending.
	4.	Visualize and interpret data for actionable insights using Tableau.

 Highlights

Impact of Category and Channel on Views

Analyzed the average views, likes, dislikes, and comments across categories. Observed that genres like Comedy tend to attract higher views.

Effect of Title, Description, and Tags

Conducted regression analysis to study the effects of title length, description length, and tag count. Found a slight positive impact of description length and tag count on views.

Time Until Trending

Explored the relationship between the time it takes to trend and viewership. Identified a weak positive correlation, suggesting other factors are more influential.

Correlation Analysis

Discovered that likes, dislikes, and comment counts have a strong correlation with views, while tag count, title length, and description length have minimal effects.

Tools and Technologies
	•	Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
	•	Visualization: Tableau 
Notable Visualizations
	•	Category-wise average views and engagement metrics
	•	Regression plots showcasing the effect of metadata on views
	•	Correlation heatmaps of key variables
	•	Tableau dashboards for interactive exploration

Conclusion

This project provides actionable insights into YouTube video performance, emphasizing the importance of likes, dislikes, and comments as key drivers of engagement. The analysis also highlights the limited influence of metadata elements like title length and tag count on viewership.
