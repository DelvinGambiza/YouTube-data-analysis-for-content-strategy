# ðŸŽ¥ YouTube data analysis for content creation strategy

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project explores trends in YouTube videos to identify key factors influencing engagement metrics such as views, likes, and dislikes. Using the `USvideos` dataset, the analysis reveals insights into how categories, metadata, and timing contribute to video performance. Python was used for preprocessing and statistical analysis, while Tableau facilitated interactive visualizations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
1. Understand how video categories impact engagement (views, likes, and dislikes).
2. Analyze the influence of metadata (e.g., title length, description length, tag count) on performance.
3. Investigate time-related trends, such as how quickly videos become trending.
4. Visualize and interpret data for actionable insights using Tableau.

## ðŸ”‘ Highlights
### Category-Based Analysis
- **Worksheet: Average likes per category**  
  Explores the distribution of likes across different video categories. Categories like Comedy and Entertainment exhibit higher average likes.
- **Worksheet: Average likes/dislikes per category - US**  
  Highlights the relationship between likes and dislikes for different content genres.

### Time to Trending
- **Worksheet: Average time to become a trending video by category**  
  Examines the average time videos from different categories take to trend. Insights reveal that some categories trend faster than others.
- **Worksheet: Average views by grouping based on time to trend**  
  Groups videos by their trending speed and analyzes their average views.

### Viewership Patterns
- **Worksheet: Average views per category - US**  
  Analyzes the average views for each category to identify the most popular genres.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Data cleaning and regression analysis using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Tableau**: Interactive visualizations for category-wise performance and time-to-trend analysis.
- **Dataset**: `USvideos.csv` (YouTube trending video data for the U.S.).

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Visualizations
- **Category-wise Engagement**: Bar charts and line graphs comparing views, likes, and dislikes across categories.
- **Time to Trend Analysis**: Grouped averages visualized to assess timing's impact on video success.
- **Metadata Effects**: Regression analysis plots showcasing the role of title length, description length, and tag count.

## ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of video categories and engagement metrics (likes and dislikes) in predicting video performance. It also shows the importance of maximizing engagement as soon as content is published since peak viewrship occurs in the first week of publishing.While metadata elements like title length and tag count have limited influence, timing plays a significant role in shaping viewership patterns. The Tableau workbook provides an interactive way to explore these findings.
